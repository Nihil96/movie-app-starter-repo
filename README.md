# The Movie App

Welcome to the starter repository for our Movie App project! In this app, we'll be using React and Redux to create a dynamic movie application with features like pagination, search functionality, animations, and responsive design. We’ll also learn how to build and deploy the app on Netlify.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

1. **The Movie Database API Key**:

   - To fetch movie data, you’ll need an API key from [The Movie Database (TMDb)](https://www.themoviedb.org/).
   - Sign up at [this link](https://www.themoviedb.org/signup). After signing up, navigate to [API Settings](https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api) to find your API Key.
   - Copy your API Key and save it somewhere accessible; you’ll need it during development.

2. **Netlify**:
   - Once we finish building the app, we’ll deploy it using Netlify. Sign up at [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) using your GitHub account. It’s a quick and easy process.

### Technologies Used

- **React** for building the user interface
- **Redux** for state management
- **SCSS** for styling
- **Axios** for handling API requests

By the end of this project, you'll have a fully functional movie app, and you’ll be comfortable with deploying your React applications. Get ready to learn, build, and deploy!
